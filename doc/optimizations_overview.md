# Optimizations for different parts of the algorithm


## Distance calculation
 - [ ] Vectorization/Intrinsics
 - [ ] dimensions (e.g. set to 4)
 - [ ] 


## Prim
 - [ ] Precomputation distance matrix
 - [ ] Memory alignment?
 - [ ] Locality?
 - [ ] Unrolling, blocks?
 - [ ] Temporal?



# Additional analyses
 * Different dimensions $$d$$
 * Compare different compiler flags and options
 * AMD vs. Intel?
 * Hand vectorized vs. compiler
 

 ## Notes
  * Memory alignment: perf events?
